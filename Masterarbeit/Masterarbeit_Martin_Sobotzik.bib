	abstract = "The SuperKEKB e+e− collider will provide 40 times higher instantaneous luminosity than the KEKB collider. The Belle II detector, located at the collision point, is the upgrade of the Belle detector. The particle identification will be improved by replacing the aerogel threshold counter with two new high performance Cherenkov detectors: the time-of-propagation (TOP) in the barrel region and the focusing aerogel (ARICH) in the forward region. The time-of-propagation sub-detector consists of quartz radiator bars and micro-channel plate photomultiplier tubes. The Cherenkov photons are produced and propagated through the quartz radiator, and after multiple internal reflections they are detected by the photomultiplier tubes. Photons with different Cherenkov angles reach different photomultiplier channels and arrive at different times. The time and the position convolution is used for the reconstruction of the Cherenkov angle. The focusing aerogel consists of a double layer aerogel radiator, an expansion volume and a photon detector. The aerogel thickness and the refractive indices of the two layers are optimized to focus the two light cones at the detection surface. The key features of these two detectors, the performance studies, and the construction progress are presented."

This new Super Flavor Factory will deliver an increased instantaneous luminosity of up to L=8×1035cm−2s−1, 40 times larger than the current KEKB machine. To exploit these new conditions and provide high precision measurements of the decay vertex of the B meson systems, a new silicon vertex detector will be operated in Belle. This new detector will consist of two layers of DEPFET Active Pixel Sensors as close as possible to the interaction point. DEPFET is a field effect transistor, with an additional deep implant underneath the channel's gate, integrated on a completely depleted bulk. This technology offers detection and an in-pixel amplification stage, while keeping low the power consumption. Under these conditions, thin sensors with small pixel size and low intrinsic noise are possible. In this article, an overview of the full system will be described, including the sensor, the front-end electronics and both the mechanical and thermal proposed solutions as well as the expected performance."

We have also achieved two-bunch beam acceleration, the development of an energy spread monitor, a safety system upgrade, and an event-based timing and control system. These developments and practical applications for advanced linac beam handling result in the success of the simultaneous top-up injection among the three independent storage rings. This result greatly improves the integrated luminosity and the operation stability of the KEKB rings. In this paper, we present the progress of the KEKB injector linac in this decade.}",
