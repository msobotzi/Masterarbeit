	abstract = "The SuperKEKB e+e− collider will provide 40 times higher instantaneous luminosity than the KEKB collider. The Belle II detector, located at the collision point, is the upgrade of the Belle detector. The particle identification will be improved by replacing the aerogel threshold counter with two new high performance Cherenkov detectors: the time-of-propagation (TOP) in the barrel region and the focusing aerogel (ARICH) in the forward region. The time-of-propagation sub-detector consists of quartz radiator bars and micro-channel plate photomultiplier tubes. The Cherenkov photons are produced and propagated through the quartz radiator, and after multiple internal reflections they are detected by the photomultiplier tubes. Photons with different Cherenkov angles reach different photomultiplier channels and arrive at different times. The time and the position convolution is used for the reconstruction of the Cherenkov angle. The focusing aerogel consists of a double layer aerogel radiator, an expansion volume and a photon detector. The aerogel thickness and the refractive indices of the two layers are optimized to focus the two light cones at the detection surface. The key features of these two detectors, the performance studies, and the construction progress are presented."

	abstract = "In our everyday environment one observes only matter. Thatʼs quite a fortunate situation! Any sizeable presence of antimatter on Earth, from the enormous energy it would release through annihilation with matter, would prevent us talking about it! For the physicist this fact, at first sight obvious, is nevertheless a kind of surprise: antimatter, which is observed in cosmic rays, in radioactive decays of nuclei, which has been copiously produced and extensively studied in accelerators and which is nowadays currently used in hospitals, turns out to have pretty much the same properties as matter. Moreover, the fact that matter dominates appears to be a general property of our Universe: no evidence of large quantities of antimatter has been observed at any distance from us. Why would matter have taken the advantage on antimatter? In this short review we explain how, through a limited number of basic elements, one can find answers to this question. Matter and antimatter have, in fact, not exactly the same properties: from laboratory experiments CP conservation is known not to be a fundamental law of nature.
	Résumé
	Dans notre vie de tous les jours nous nʼappréhendons que de la matière et rien ne nous indique à première vue quʼil puisse exister de lʼantimatière. Bienheureux sommes nous ! La présence dʼune quelconque quantité macroscopique dʼantimatière autour de nous, par lʼénergie quʼelle dégagerait en sʼannihilant avec la matière, nous empêcherait dʼêtre là pour en parler ! Cet état de chose est cependant une surprise pour le physicien : lʼantimatière qui est aujourdʼhui bien connue — étant observée et utilisée tous les jours dans les rayons cosmiques, les processus radioactifs, les accélérateurs de particules et les hôpitaux — a des propriétés très similaires à celles de la matière. De plus le fait que la matière domine apparaît être une caractéristique générale de notre univers : aucune trace dʼune grande quantité dʼantimatière nʼa été observée à quelque distance que ce soit. Pourquoi la matière aurait-elle donc pris le pas sur lʼantimatière ? Dans ce Fascicule nous expliquons brièvement comment à partir dʼun nombre restreint dʼéléments de base lʼon peut trouver des réponses à cette question, en commençant par un ingrédient crucial : il a été observé en laboratoire que la conservation de la symétrie CP nʼest pas une loi de la nature."

This new Super Flavor Factory will deliver an increased instantaneous luminosity of up to L=8×1035cm−2s−1, 40 times larger than the current KEKB machine. To exploit these new conditions and provide high precision measurements of the decay vertex of the B meson systems, a new silicon vertex detector will be operated in Belle. This new detector will consist of two layers of DEPFET Active Pixel Sensors as close as possible to the interaction point. DEPFET is a field effect transistor, with an additional deep implant underneath the channel's gate, integrated on a completely depleted bulk. This technology offers detection and an in-pixel amplification stage, while keeping low the power consumption. Under these conditions, thin sensors with small pixel size and low intrinsic noise are possible. In this article, an overview of the full system will be described, including the sensor, the front-end electronics and both the mechanical and thermal proposed solutions as well as the expected performance."

We have also achieved two-bunch beam acceleration, the development of an energy spread monitor, a safety system upgrade, and an event-based timing and control system. These developments and practical applications for advanced linac beam handling result in the success of the simultaneous top-up injection among the three independent storage rings.
